            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>In many ways, <strong>mental health is just like physical health: everybody  has it and we need to take care of it</strong>. Good mental health means being generally able to think, feel and  react in the ways that you need and want to live your life. But if you  go through a period of poor mental health you might find the ways you’re frequently thinking, feeling or reacting become difficult, or even impossible, to cope with. This can feel just as bad as a physical illness, or even worse. You might be given a diagnosis of a particular type of mental health problem. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. <strong>Everyone’s experience is different and can change at different times</strong>. However, in reality, mental health problems are a common human experience. Most people know someone who has experienced a mental health problem, they affect around one in four people in any given year. They can happen to all kinds of people from all walks of life.  And it’s likely that, <strong>when you find a combination of self-care, treatment and support that works for you, you will get better.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Depression</strong> is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your  self-esteem, sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health. Next, <strong>anxiety</strong> is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things<strong> </strong>that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future. Besides, <strong>obsessive</strong> <strong>compulsive disorder</strong> is a type of anxiety disorder. The term  is often misused in daily conversation – for example, you might hear people talk about being ‘a bit OCD’, if they like things to be neat and tidy. But the reality of this disorder is a lot more complex and serious. <strong>Eating disorder</strong> are not just about food. They can be about difficult and painful feelings which you may be finding hard to face or resolve. Lots of people think that if you have an eating problem you will be over- or underweight. <strong>Phobias</strong> is an extreme form of fear or anxiety triggered by particular situation (such as going outside) or object (such as spiders), even when it’s very unlikely to be dangerous. A fear becomes a phobia if the fear  is out of proportion to the danger, it lasts for more than six months,  and has a significant impact on how you live your day-to-day life.<strong>Bi-polar disorders </strong>(once called manic depression) mainly affects  your mood. Views on <strong>Schizophrenia</strong> have changed over the years. Lots of people question whether it’s really a distinct condition, or actually a few different conditions that overlap. <strong>Personality disorder</strong> is a type of mental health problem where your attitudes, beliefs and behaviours cause you longstanding problems  in your life. If you have this diagnosis it doesn’t mean that you’re fundamentally different from other people.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Panic attacks</strong> are a type of fear response. They’re an exaggeration  of your body’s normal response to danger, stress or excitement. During a panic attack physical symptoms can build up very quickly, including a pounding heartbeat or chest pains, sweating and nausea (feeling sick), feeling faint and unable to breathe, shaky limbs, or feeling like your legs are turning to jelly and feeling as if you aren’t connected to your body. Next, <strong>Self-harm</strong> is when you hurt yourself as a way of dealing with very difficult feelings, painful memories or overwhelming situations and experiences. You may not know why you self-harm, but it can be a means of expressing feelings that you can’t put into words or think clearly about. After self-harming you may feel a short-term sense of release, but the cause of your distress is unlikely to have gone away. Self-harm can also bring up very difficult emotions and could make you feel worse. Besides, <strong>Psychosis</strong>  (also called a psychotic experience or psychotic episode)  is when you perceive or interpret reality in a very different way from people around you. The most common types of psychosis are hallucinations, such as hearing voices or having visions and delusions, such as paranoia. Finally, many people experience <strong>suicidal thoughts and feelings</strong> at some point  in their lifetime. They can be very unpleasant, intrusive and frightening, but having thoughts about suicide doesn’t necessarily mean that you intend to act on them. Most people don’t go on to attempt to take their own lives.
</p><p>Mental health problems can have a wide range of causes. It’s likely  that for many people there is a complicated combination of factors– although different people may be more deeply affected by certain things than others. For example, the following factors could potentially result in a period of poor mental health such as <strong>childhood abuse, trauma, or neglect,  domestic violence, bullying or other abuse as an adult, social isolation or loneliness.</strong> On the other hand, <strong>experiencing discrimination and stigma and social disadvantage, poverty or debt</strong> are also the factors of potentially result in a period of poor mental health. The last factors are <strong>bereavement (losing someone close to you), severe or long-term stress and having a long-term physical health condition 
</strong></p><p>Research suggests that some mental health problems may run in families. For example, if you have a parent with schizophrenia, you  are more likely to develop schizophrenia yourself. But no one knows  if this is because of our genes or because of other factors, such as  the environment we grow up in, or the ways of thinking, coping and behaving that we may learn from our parents.
</p><p>Although the development of some mental health problems may be influenced by our genes, researchers haven’t found any specific genes that definitely cause mental health problems. And many people who experience a mental health problem don’t have any parents, children  or other relatives with the same condition.

        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>First, <strong>stay aware of your mental health</strong> by <strong>telling people what helps</strong>. If certain treatments have helped in the past, tell your doctor. Let your friends and family know how they can support you. Next, <strong>spot your early warning signs.</strong> Try to be aware of how you’re feeling and watch out for any signs you might be becoming unwell, so you can get support as soon as possible. Finally, <strong>keep a mood diary</strong>. Tracking your moods can help you to work out what makes you feel better or worse. You can then take steps to avoid, change or prepare for difficult situations. You can create your own mood diary or find one online. Next, <strong>nourish your social life Feeling connected to other people is important. </strong>It can help you  to feel valued and confident about yourself, and can give you a  different perspective on things. If you can, try to spend some time connecting with friends and family – even a text or phone call can  make a difference.
</p><p>If you don’t have supportive friends and family around you and are feeling isolated, there are other ways you can make connections.  For example, you could try going to community events where you  might have some interests or experiences in common with other  people there, or joining a group like a local book club or sports team.
</p><p>On the other hand,<strong> try peer support</strong>. When you experience a mental health problem it can feel like no one understands. Peer support brings together people who’ve had similar experiences to support each other. This can offer many benefits, such as <strong>feeling accepted for who you are, increased self-confidence, meeting new people and using your experiences to help others, finding out new information and places for support and challenging stigma and discrimination</strong>. On top of that, <strong>make time for therapeutic activities</strong> There are various techniques and therapies you can safely practice  on your own. For example <strong>relaxation</strong> – you may already know what helps you relax, like having a bath, listening to music or taking your dog for a walk.  If you know that a certain activity helps you feel more relaxed, make sure you set aside time to do it. <strong>Mindfulness</strong> is a therapeutic technique that involves being more aware of the present moment. Practicing mindfulness can help you become more aware of your own moods and reactions, but not everyone finds it helpful. <strong>Getting into nature</strong> – getting out into a green environment, such  as a park or the countryside, is especially good for you. Even if  you don’t have a garden or aren’t very mobile, caring for plants  or animals indoors can still help you get some benefits from nature. After that, <strong>contact a specialist organization</strong>. If you have a particular mental health diagnosis, or would like help  in a specific aspect of your life, there may be specialist charities and organizations out there who can offer support. 
</p><p>Lastly, look after your physical health. Taking steps to<strong> look after your physical health</strong> can help you manage your mental health too <strong>get enough sleep</strong>. Rest when you can. This can help you have  the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences. <strong>Avoid recreational drugs and alcohol.</strong> While you might want to use recreational drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, in the long run they can make you feel a lot worse. <strong>Make time for personal care.
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;When you’re experiencing a mental health problem, it’s easy for personal care to not feel like a priority. But small everyday things, such as taking a shower and getting fully dressed, can make a big difference to how you feel. <strong>Eat healthily</strong>. What you eat, and when you eat, can make a big difference to how well you feel. <strong>Keep physically active. 
</strong></p><p>Regular exercise doesn’t have to be very strenuous or sporty to be effective – to start with you could try gentle exercise like going for a short walk, yoga or swimming. The important thing is to pick something you enjoy doing, so  you’re more likely to stick with it.
