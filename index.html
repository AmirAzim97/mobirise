            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p><strong>In this era of globalization, health is seen as a serious social problem for a country. This problem can affect an individual, a community or a country. This problem is often associated with a relatively old age group. However, due to the rapid growth of time and development, it has resulted in serious health problems for every segment of the community since the baby is seen as a problem in Malaysia, which has become increasingly alarming. Many people who are suffering from a variety of chronic or even common diseases, regardless of age and gender, are looking at this problem.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>Generally, health can be defined as one of the most important aspects of human life because health is a very precious God's gift. This definition is also an indication to each individual that it is natural that each individual approaches and deepens and practices a healthy lifestyle so that the health of the body and mind are always ensured. This is because, it is undeniable that at this time, it can be said with a rich age of various types of foods and beverages that are readily available.
</strong></p><p><strong>In 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined health with a phrase that is still used today. "Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." WHO, 1948. In 1986, the WHO further clarified that health is "A resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities." This means that health is a resource to support an individual's function in wider society. A healthful lifestyle provides the means to lead a full life.
</strong></p><p><strong>More recently, researchers have defined health as the ability of a body to adapt to new threats and infirmities. They base this on the idea that modern science has dramatically increased human awareness of diseases and how they work in the last few decades.
</strong></p><p><strong>According to the National Health and Morbidities study together with the Ministry of Health Malaysia, the number has increased from year to year and it is very concern for Malaysians. Food intake is absolutely essential to the human body. Hence, an individual should know the type of food that is taken in accordance with the needs of the body.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;In addition, the benefits of healthy living are improving your health status, reduce your risk of getting diseases such as diabetes, heart attack, stroke and hypertension, and lastly make you look and feel better to enjoy life. To accomplish this, to achieve wellbeing in life, health plays an enormous role. Physical and mental health should be emphasized as they are interconnected with one another. Good health is capable of producing a productive and competitive individual who also has a positive impact on society and the nation.
</strong></p><p><strong>No human being who has a good sense of mind wants to live an unhealthy life. All human beings on this earth dream of a healthy life either physically or mentally. In this context, it is not natural to blame anyone for being an individual who wants a healthy life would have the knowledge to practice and control the intake of food in the day.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Health also has changing concept. Firstly, Biomedical Concept means health has been viewed as an “absence of disease”, and if one was free from disease the person was considered healthy. Secondly, Ecological Concept that’s means health implies the relative absence of pain and discomfort and a continuous adaptation and adjustment to the environment to ensure optimal function. Thirdly, Psychosocial Concept that’s show the health is both a biological and social phenomenon. Lastly, Holistic Concept. The Holistic Concept is a sound mind in a sound body, in a sound family, in a sound environment; All sectors of society like agriculture, animal husbandry, food, industry, education, housing, public works, communication &amp; other sectors have an effect on health. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we know that health is multidimensional, WHO definition envisages three (3) specific dimensions, however there are many more dimensions. First and foremost is physical. The physical is perfect functioning of the body. What are the Signs of Physical Health? The evaluation of physical health is self-assessment of overall health, inquiry into symptoms of ill health and risk factors, inquiry into medications, inquiry into level of activity, inquiry into use of medical services, standardized questionnaires for cardiovascular diseases, standardized questionnaires for respiratory diseases, clinical examination, nutrition and dietary assessment and biochemical and laboratory investigations. Secondly, mental. Mental Health has been defined as “a state of balance between the individual and the surrounding world, a state of harmony between oneself and others, a coexistence between the realities of the self and that of other people and that of the environment”. The attributes of a mentally healthy person include free from internal conflicts, is not at war with him or herself, well adjusted: Is able to get along well with others. 
</strong></p><p><strong>Accepts criticism and is not easily upset, searches for identity, has a strong sense of self-esteem, knows oneself, one’s need, problems and goals (this is known as self-actualization), has good self-control, balances rationality and emotionality, faces problems and tries to solve them intelligently, i.e., coping with stress and anxiety. One of the keys to good health is positive mental health. Thirdly, social. Social wellbeing implies “Quality and quantity of an individuals’ interpersonal ties and the extent of involvement with the community”. Social health takes into account that every individual is a part of a family and a wider community and focuses on social and economic conditions and well-being of the “Whole Person” in the context of his social network. Social Health is rooted in “Positive material environment” (focusing on financial and residential matters) and “Positive human environment” which is concerned with social network of the individual. Fourthly, spiritual. Spiritual health in this context, refers to that part of the individual which reaches out and strives for meaning and purpose in life) This dimension seems to defy concrete definition. It includes integrity, principles of ethics, purpose in life, commitment to some higher being, belief in concepts that are not subject to “state of the art” explanation. Fifthly, emotional. Initially mental and emotional dimensions were seen one in the same thing but as more research becomes available a definite difference is emerging. Mental health can be seen as “Knowing” or “Cognition”, while emotional health refers to “Feeling”. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, health depends on a wide range of factors. A person is born with a range of genes, and in some people, an unusual genetic pattern can lead to a less-than-optimum level of health. Environmental factors play a role. Sometimes the environment alone is enough to impact health. Other times, an environmental trigger can cause illness in a person who is genetically susceptible. 
</strong></p><p><strong>Access to healthcare plays a role, but the WHO suggests that the following factors may have a bigger impact on health than where a person lives, the state of the surrounding environment, genetics, income, education level, relationships with friends and family. These can be summarized as the social and economic environment: Including how wealthy a family or community is the physical environment including parasites that exist in an area, or pollution levels. The person's characteristics and behaviours including the genes that a person is born with and their lifestyle choices. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the WHO, the higher a person's socioeconomic status (SES), the more likely they are to enjoy good health, a good education, a well-paid job, afford good healthcare when their health is threatened. People with a lower socioeconomic status are more likely to experience stresses related to daily living, such as financial difficulties, marital disruption, and unemployment, as well as social factors, such as marginalization and discrimination. All these add to the risk of poor health. A low socio-economic status often means less access to healthcare. People in developed countries with universal healthcare services have longer life expectancies than people in developed countries without universal healthcare.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cultural issues can affect health. The traditions and customs of a society and a family's response to them can have a good or bad impact on health. For example, around the Mediterranean, people are more likely to consume high levels of fruits, vegetables, and olive, and to eat as a family, compared with cultures with a high consumption of fast food. How a person manages stress will affect health? People who smoke, drink, or take drugs to forget their problems are likely to have more health problems later than someone who combats stress through a healthful diet and exercise. Men and women are prone to different health factors. In societies where women earn less than men or are less educated, they may be at greater risk than men for poor health.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The best way to maintain health is to preserve it through a healthful lifestyle, rather than waiting until we are sick to put things right. This state of enhanced well-being is referred to as wellness. The McKinley Health Centre at the University of Illinois IL defines wellness as "A state of optimal well-being that is oriented toward maximizing an individual's potential. This is a life-long process of moving towards enhancing your physical, intellectual, emotional, social, spiritual, and environmental well-being." Wellness promotes an active awareness of and participation in health, as an individual and in the community. Maintaining wellness and optimal health is a lifelong, daily commitment.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Steps that can help us maximize our health include, a balanced, nutritious diet, sourced as naturally as possible. Then, regular exercising, screening for diseases that may present a risk, learning to manage stress, engaging in activities that provide purpose and connection to others, maintaining a positive outlook and appreciating what you have, defining a value system, and putting it into action. Peak health will be different for each person, and how you achieve wellness may be different from how someone else does. It may not be possible to avoid disease completely, but doing as much as we can to develop resilience and prepare the body and mind to deal with problems as they arise is a step, we can all take.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Practicing balanced nutrition is important as a step towards maintaining our health. Nutrition practices are closely related to one's health. It coincides with the English proverb on nutrition practices, "What you are, is what you eat". It can be said that a person who practices a balanced diet will get good health. Exercising a balanced diet means that someone takes a nutritious and nutritious meal according to the needs of a person's body. An individual needs appropriate food based on age, occupation and other needs. For example, a baby needs more calcium than adults who need more protein. To be clear, one needs to refer to the food pyramid as a guide for getting a balanced nutrition. In this regard, snacks and gourmet drinks should be avoided as it can harm our health. In short, the best way to achieve health is by practicing a balanced diet.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our health will be more secure if we do recreational activities. Leisure activities like swimming, jogging, cycling and other sports activities are good for health. University Science Mara Sport Science Lecturer (UiTM), Associate Professor. Zulkifli Abdul Kadir, suggests that each individual performs recreational activities for 30 minutes twice a week to get optimal health. By doing leisure activities, the muscles of the body will be more energetic and the body will improve. In addition, one can breathe fresh air when doing exercise on the playground and can reduce stress or stress after a day's work in the office. It is strongly recommended so that we can do exercise activities in order to get good health.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In conclusion, the public's awareness of the importance of health needs to be improved. This step is important so that every individual can discipline themselves, especially in terms of nutrition and hygiene care. Without such awareness, the public will not care about a healthy lifestyle. To increase the public's knowledge about this, guidance on healthcare needs to be disseminated. Hopefully the "Good Healthy Practices" that we say are truly a reality in Malaysia. Hopefully Malaysians are concerned with a healthy lifestyle in their daily lives.
