</strong></p><p><strong>3.	Create own home gym&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>For a small cost, you don’t need a fancy gym to do bodyweight exercises. Just find some suitable heavy objects like use the full plastic bottles with filled with rice or something heavy. It is very simple things to buy because it is not too expensive and also easy to keep store. At the same time, you can still exercise at home by running up and down the stairs to get your heart going. Everything comes from yourself. 
</strong></p><p><strong>4.	Walk
</strong></p><p><strong>Building up stamina over time is must, so the first thing you should do is replace your trips on public transport with walking. Why you not get off the bus one step early before class? It will helps you calculate calories burned during exercise, even walking.
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Question 2 : When is the best time of day to work out?
</strong></p><p><strong>Actually, the truth is its personal things. We all knows that some people might busy with their work hard to do anything else. It depends on someone when is the best time, because the benefits of physical activity depend upon how consistent you are. Maybe dawn or maybe early in the morning. For example, of you are not a morning person, it may not work for you and try to get up at dawn to work out. Plenty of people look the benefits of early morning to work out, but if you cannot fit in a workout before noon, don’t sweat it.  It will nothing for your health. But, there are some tips here that “exercise anytime is better than none at all” said Mohammad Saufi Bin Mohamad Fadzli, come FKP’s student.
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Question 3 : How to make exercise be more fun?
</strong></p><p><strong>1.	Exercise with a friend
</strong></p><p><strong>Exercise with a friend or loved one can make it more fun. We are less likely to get bored when have a work out buddy, especially a friend. By going with a friend, we can get more motivation from them and also can laugh together in the process of exercising.
</strong></p><p><strong>2.	Choose an exercise love&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Select an exercise that we love are something funny. For instance, if we love dancing, then take up dance classes. That is the simplest way we can do to make an exercise more fun and good.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>3.	Listen to music&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>With so many podcast and music apps available on our smartphone, we can easily find entertainment options perfectly suite to our personal tastes. Never worry what people think about us, just use an earphones and get lost in our own world. As we all know, music can improve a good performance by listening to a beat of music.
