            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p><strong>There are many tips to prepare the healthy foods and it depends to individual’s way. Firstly, before preparing the healthy foods, we must make sure it starts from the ingredients, that mean clean and in good condition. Secondly, the way of preparing it, as a Muslim, the process surely according to Islamic way which is ‘halal toyyiban’. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thirdly, after preparing, make sure the ingredients from the fresh ingredients and the chosen food must have nutrition according to our needs such as protein, carbohydrates and fats according to its percentage. So that from the term of ingredients. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then, people who preparing the food must in clean condition and wear the suitable gloves to avoid from any dirty. The additional of flavoring can make the food delicious and feel better but it does not need to be added too much because not good for health.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When serving the foods, let only the clean one serves in the plate and as a meal. When had prepare, the foods must be covered as it is not expose to the insects like flies and cockroach that can cause poison to those who eat the meals? 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Generally, in Malaysia, the department of health from state and district will conduct to check the cafeteria or food stalls. While checking, the department will give grade to the cafe or restaurant according to the requirements that have been set for every restaurant, so choose the best grade which is A Grade. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Grade A will be given to the restaurant after they checks from the whole side of the restaurant, which are from the owner’s health, from immunization injection to the owner and workers and also the way of keep and prepare the ingredients.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As we know, the problem of body weight is because of taking more food than necessary. Secondly, is lack of exercise because of too busy with work and class but worse when not exercise because of lazy. So, to decrease the obesity, we have to tackle both of this problem.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Malaysia, the problem is we are too rich with variety types of foods, so the way of taking the daily meals must balance means according to our needs and eat at least thrice a day. We have to reduce eating junk foods such as pizza, McDonald and KFC and when buy foods from restaurant or stalls, we must clever in choose it that means eat the balance meal contains all ingredients in food pyramid. Foods that rich with carbohydrate such as roti canai or burger, we have to cut down, that’s in term of taking the foods.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, we had practiced healthy lifestyle which is doing exercise minimum thrice a week in only 45 minutes or five times in half an hour each, so doing exercise regularly and from our daily movement by increase movement such as walking when the place not too far. Only sometimes ride the car if necessary or if the place not too high, we just climb the stairs to strongest our leg and don’t take lift because lift does not help us in exercise.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The good and healthy body surely through control exercise and control the intake of foods.  Now, I see many of supplement released and there is claim if someone take the supplement, she will become thin and health. But we also must remember that every medicine or unnatural things, it will give the side effect to our health. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes, we know that some medicine can controls the weight of body only at that time. When the person leaves or forget not eating the supplement, it will give effect to the user such as become fat back or fatter than before because the medicine control metabolism or appetite, so the medicine known as unnatural. The good of management for health is by natural way, it will longer be lasting because it will change our lifestyle and can be seen our effort towards health not only by taking the easy way.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Supplement come from English word that means extra, so ask ourselves does we need the extra food or not? If we are in healthy category, not having healthy problem such as digestion problem, so take only the balance meals. Maybe we don’t need any supplement and better to take food in natural way, like fruits, vegetables and not oily food.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Supplement has variety of types, usually in supermarket or online can be seen in drinks version or tablet in many flavors. Actually, supplement can be taken if being approved by KKM as it does not contain any poison ingredients. Sometimes, there’re synthetic hormone in supplement which is not good to be taken. Before buy the supplement, don’t forget to read the ingredients and ask the believe one.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For old people, if they can’t digest the foods, they are encouraged to eat the supplement to help them in digestion or for person that always busy with work and not enough time to eat adequately, they can take the supplement. Otherwise there’s no suitable causes to take the supplement.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every category of age or person, they have their own ideal weight to achieved. When involve weight and height, we always measure it using BMI (Body Max Index), it can help people to measure the correct weight and height according to someone age.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If they exceeded the specific types of weight, we will say that he or she had an obesity or too thin if not enough weight. Usually, children do not include in obesity category, but we can detect that the children had an obesity if they have achieved the maximum weight and not match with their height. So, ideal weight depends on specific factor not standard that means in this age she or he must in this weight.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Malaysia is rich in food and it is cheap and easy to be found. As a parent, we need to be sensitive and concerned about the nutrition that our children take. Children cannot be overdone because of the many problems that will arise as well as invites various diseases. As parents we are obliged to provide nutrition tables for children. &nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>“I make sure that I cook is a substance that feeds on the daily needs of my children.” Said Mrs. Kamariyah Mustafa during the interview. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a father, I strongly insist that my children reduce the intake of fast food. In my opinion, such foods are not suitable for daily meals because of high salt content.
</strong></p><p><strong>Besides, in addition, Mrs. Kamariyah also monitors the activities of children to use time properly and beneficial. To get a good night's sleep, we have a schedule for children, for example dinner at 8 to 9 pm, then limit watching television to no more than 10 pm. We are always recommended to sleep seven to eight hours each day, or to sleep early and get up faster. This is because of the benefits and advantages of early sleep and getting enough sleep. Among the advantages is to lose one's weight because with early sleep, we do not tend to overeat. If we go to bed early, when we wake up the next morning, we will feel fresh and can do the activity easily without feeling lethargic and weak. Next, our heart will be healthier and more energetic because if someone sleeps late at midnight it is found to have hardening of blood vessels from those who always sleep early. It is more important for children and it is recommended to sleep early because it affects immunity and focus on an activity. In Islam we are also recommended for early sleeping, the Prophet Muhammad SAW also urged his ummah to sleep early to get a healthy body. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Allah said in surah An-Naba verse 9:
</strong></p><p><strong>وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا
</strong></p><p><strong>Meaning: “And We made your sleep for rest.”
</strong></p><p><strong>“I always insist on children to sleep early and limit the use of the phone at night.” Said Mr. Bakri during the interview.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Generally, we know that by exercising, we can maintain a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, we have to carry out beneficial activities to maintain our body condition. Here are some benefits when we do exercise. Among them is, strengthening the heart. Exercising not only makes us feel better and fresh, but also strengthens our heart condition. Cardiac responses can be more efficient. The heart will also continue to practice to become stronger. A strong heart muscle attempts to help prevent heart disease. In addition, Reduce Blood Sugar Rate. Exercise is able to smooth muscle to take glucose in the blood and turn it into energy. It is important to reduce the risk of developing diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases, due to lack of physical activity. In addition, exercise is also good for bones and joints. The hard-working people have stronger, stronger bones than those with a lazy exercise. Rarely exercising can also make our joints stiff and weak. Everyone also wants skin like youth, so with exercise will make our skin healthier and more radiant. One of the health benefits of skin that is worth paying attention is to exercise. The skin needs nutrients to stay healthy and maintain elasticity and moisture. Exercising will increase the heartbeat so that it can smoothen blood transfusions, while delivering good nutrients to skin cells. Exercising can reduce acne in your face and body. Acne usually comes with external and internal factors. One of the internal factors that invites acne is stress. Exercising will help your body become more relaxed and avoid stress.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every evening, after returning from work, “I will invite my children to work in the park for example riding a bike.” Said Mr. Bakri again in the interview. 
</strong></p><p><strong>The Arabic proverb says: 
</strong></p><p><strong>العَقْلُ السَّلِيمُ في الجِسمِ السَّلِيْمِ
</strong></p><p><strong>Meaning: “A healthy mind on the active brain.”

However, not everyone want keeps the diet healthy to stay healthy. Knowledge in practicing healthy lifestyles is essential for creating awareness to adopt a healthy lifestyle to maintain health. Below are tips that were shared by Anisah during her interview.
</strong></p><p><strong>To be a healthy person is not easy. Need a positive mindset to continue a healthy lifestyle and need a positive environment from family and friends. She tells that Alhamdulillah, she gets that positive environment and always positive to get a positive mindset. The spirit she takes to continue this healthy lifestyle is also from her own family.  This is because Anisah family has a hereditary cancer disease. In order to prevent the disease from falling on her, she is determined and chooses to live in a healthy lifestyle.
</strong></p><p><strong>Then, not easy to achieved her goals in diet, she tries her best in find the best coach through online even it has to be paid. She has to follow the instruction from an experienced coach in health. Her effort can be seen when she cannot eat like usually and had to inform to the coach every meal that she eats as a report and also for guide to the coach in calculate her daily calories to make sure she only can eat what suitable for her body to become thin than before. After three months, she stopped take the coach as her guider in diet because she had known all the diet flow but she still consistent follow the advice and guide from the coach. Avoid eating greasy foods either fried or sweet foods. Abstinence from eating sweet foods, because sweet foods are the main factors contributing to obesity  
</strong></p><p><strong>Intermittent fasting is not a diet. Intermittent fasting is a method to regulate eating habits by eating fasting for some time, but you can still consume drinks. Compared to the term "diet" which usually refers to reduction or eating restrictions, more intermittent fasting methods to regulate you’re eating habits.
</strong></p><p><strong>Intermittent fasting does not regulate what foods should be reduced or what to consume, but rather regulate when you eat and when to stop eating "fasting". Usually this method recommends eating fasting for 16 hours, but the time you can determine for yourself. Intermittent fasting may have some health benefits, including weight loss but is not suitable for everyone. 
</strong></p><p><strong>From the interview, Anisah told she would drink plenty of water, every day she would spend 3 liters of water. In that case, she explains that the daily intake of 3 liters of water helps to remind the body's metabolism. In addition, the 3-liter water intake also helps us to make the body healthier and get a balanced diet. Anisah also explained that she did not take sugary and carbonated drinks since he started practicing a healthy lifestyle till now. From that point he began to realize that sugary drink intake was not good for health, because taking sugary drinks would cause us to fall into dangerous diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cause one's weight to grow. This is because, many harms come from the good of our body. In conclusion, drinking plenty of water is important for our body to stay healthy and indirectly drink plenty of water as well as help maintain youthfulness and look younger than age.

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5">Tips to Improve Your Physical Health<br><br><div>1. Walk</div><div>It may seem simple, but walking can help you burn a lot of calories in a short amount of time. In fact, a person who weights 160 pounds can burn over 90 calories in about 30 minutes going at a slow pace. And there are many, other daily activities you do regularly that can help you burn calories like laundry, gardening, cleaning, brushing your teeth, and more! You may find that your favorite hobby is actually a good workout.
</div><div><br></div><div>2.	Exercise from a Chair
</div><div>If you are confined to a chair or stuck sitting at work all day, check out these exercises from Forbes.com. My favourite webs is the “Wooden Leg.” You just raise one leg in front of you, hold it for a couple of seconds and then put it down. Repeat alternating your legs, and you can increase the strength of your lower body without leaving your desk.
</div><div><br></div><div>3.	Just Breathe
</div><div>Instead of just focusing on your physical activities, it’s important to slow down a bit as well. Take some time for yourself. Find a quiet place where you can lie down and relax. You can meditate or simply listen to the sounds around you. Breathe slowly and deeply and let go of your cares with each exhale. When you finish, you’ll be calmer and ready to take on your next challenge.
</div><div><br></div><div>4.	Stretch
</div><div>After you are done with your quiet time, you may want to do some light stretching. It will help your body avoid injury and improve recovery and flexibility. One of my favorite stretches is really simple. Bring your shoulders up to your ears as high as you can and hold for about 10 seconds and crinkle your face up too. Then, let everything go and repeat. You won’t believe how much stress is lurking in your shoulders and face! (And a brief warning; you may want to make sure you are alone for this this stretching activity). Otherwise, it could be caught on camera and show up on social media.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>5.	Use your own body
</div><div>If you avoid exercising because you don’t have the appropriate equipment or a gym membership, you can get rid of that excuse right now! There are some fantastic ways to use your own body as part of a resistance-training programme. For example, in addition to standard push-ups and sit-ups, try a plank or the “Superman or Superwoman.” To help strengthen your lower back, here, you simple lie on the ground facing down, and slowly lift your arms, legs and head up, hold for five seconds, let go, and repeat.

</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5"><div><strong>1. Get treatment from a doctor
</strong></div><div>When we find that someone has signs of mental illness, get medical treatment immediately. Do not let it drag on, worry about getting protracted and to the point of endangering suicide.
</div><div><strong>2. Keep your body healthy
</strong></div><div>Fulfill the rights to the body. Keep nutrition by eating nutritious and timely food. Make sure the sport becomes weekly routine. Becoming a smart and mindful one is a demand in Islam to avoid any illness.
</div><div><strong>3. Keep spiritual
</strong></div><div>As one eats to feed the stomach, so is our internal need for food to meet internal requirements. The Word of Allah: "O Believers, ask for help (with Allah) with patience and prayer" (al-Baqarah : verse 153). This verse clearly explains when a person is in trouble, be patient in facing him and pray.
</div><div><strong>4. Hang with people
</strong></div><div>Humans need each other. The Prophet himself emphasized the silaturrahim of a fellow Muslim. Avoid staying alone because it will lead to a sense of humor and love. That attitude is very dangerous, because without knowing it is eating. Discuss the problem with people we trust and a little bit of relief.
