            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Healthy diet refers to nutrition that encompasses a wide range of food groups taken by an individual in the amount recommended in accordance with the needs of a person's body. About 3 groups which is children, adults, and seniors each of these individual groups require different amounts of macronutrients and micronutrients.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Macronutrient refers to the food components required in large quantities of carbohydrates, proteins and fats that will be counted as calories. Micronutrients also refer to components such as vitamins and minerals that are needed by the human body in a small quantity but important to ensure that the human body system is functioning properly.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;According to Recommended Nutrient Intakes for Malaysia 2017 (RNI 2017), boys aged 4 to 9 require 1300-70 calories per day while girls aged 4 to 9 years need 1210-1810 calories per day. Adult mans need 1960-2470 calories per day while adult women need 1610-2130 calories per day. Citizens aged 60 and above need 1780-2280 calories for men and 1550-1990 calories for women. It should be noted that the total calorie requirement for any group or individual depends on the level of physical activity either less active, moderately active, or highly active.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Of course, healthy eating habits should be nurtured starting from home again by parents and their families. This is because unhealthy eating habits will lead to excessive weight problems during childhood and will continue to adulthood if these children are not given proper exposure to healthy eating.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Nowadays Malaysia often facing an increase in the number of overweight children. According to the National Health and Morbidity Survey study conducted in 2015 or more commonly known as the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2015, the percentage of children aged 18 years and under who have overweight problems of 11.9% compared to 6-8 % experienced worldwide. Children should be given guidance and exposure to healthy nutrition such as food selection at school canteens, healthy snack selection and so on.
</strong></p><p><em>وكلوا واشربوا ولا تسرفوا، إنه لا يحب المرفين) 31)</em></p><p><strong>“And eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He likes not those who commit excess,” (Al-A’raf, 31: 8)
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;As human need to take food and drink in proportion to our self and do not overdo it to waste food. Of course there is when we are going to take over the food that was initially expected to be consumed and delicious. Exaggerating in eating and drinking is what leads to one of the unhealthy nutritional causes. For those who are trying to lose weight, they are advised to meet with a medical officer or dietetic officer so they can be helped in the right way. Healthy eating alongside active lifestyle such as exercise and recreation are two key ways to maintain the body's ideal.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Every human being has its own way to have a healthy and vibrant body. Apart from exercising and sporting, taking care our daily food is also important to us to stay healthy in doing work and daily activities. However, to get a healthy and vibrant body, we need to take care our daily food especially the number of calories consumed in our food every day.
</strong></p><p><strong>The three types of dishes that a normal individual can consume to be healthy are, the first one is 1200 calories. This meal is best suited to those who want to lose weight, but they need to consult a dietician official or a qualified food science officer so that every meal taken in suitable quantities. For a 1200 calorie dish, the menu that can be taken for breakfast is a plate of fried rice and tea with non-fat milk or tea without sugar. After that, for lunch we need a plate of rice, Indian mackerel in soy bean paste, Choy Sim soup, papaya and plain water. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Next, for an afternoon tea, take the food should not have high calorie so we can balance our nutrition schedule such as honey dew, tea with non-fat milk or tea without sugar and for dinner the types of food that can be taken is soup vermicelli, orange and plain water. Second, 1500 calorie, the menu that can be taken for breakfast is one piece chapatti, one small bowl yellow dhal gravy and one glass low fat milk. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;After that, morning drinking is also necessary - just take half whole guava as a meal. For lunch, the types of food that can be prepared are one plate white rice, one slice Spanish mackerel curry without coconut milk, one medium bowl of fried cabbage, whole red apple and also one glass of plain water and for afternoon tea, just take one piece of putu bamboo and one small glass of tea with low fat milk. For diner, we can eat one piece of dosai with one small bowl of yellow dhal gravy, coconut chutney and one whole of banana and one glass plain water. 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Lastly is 1800 calorie, an example of this 1800 calorie diet is suitable for those who are not doing heavy work and working in the office. This is not a diet for skinny but to maintain the existing weight and the examples of food dishes for breakfast are one medium soup noodle and one small glass malted drinks (low fat milk). After that, morning tea we can eat cake and black instant coffee with one teaspoon sugar. However, dishes for afternoon tea are red bean porridge with black tea and dinner we can take one plate of white rice with one small kerapu steam with ginger and Chou Sim soup. We also need some food and one glass of plain water.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Calorie counting is very important to prevent us from taking over calorie from what we need that this over calorie will turn into fat and accumulate in our body. However, very important for us to maintain our calorie to avoid harmful diseases in our life.

                            <p class="mbr-text mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">How do you consistent in dietary care with a solid study schedule?
<br>
<br>For me, it can be consistent in maintaining my diet as I have set a daily meal schedule. It's usually divided into five which is breakfast, lunch, tea time, dinner and supper. When I was busy with my assignment and if it was my meal time, I would take rest for a while and eat what I had prepared before going to the class. This is because the right nutrition time can make the body feel fresher and energetic.
<br>
<br>How much quantity of food you take per day to stay healthy	
<br>
<br>The quantity of food is taken very important for anyone who wants to maintain health and weight. And if you ask me how much quantity take by me is certainly very different from others because everybody have different body metabolisms. But what is important for a person who wants to take care of the body, make sure that calories intake is nothing more than what the body needs, and make sure that nutrients such as protein, carbohydrate and fat are enough to keep the body energetic throughout the day.
<br>
<br>Besides rice and fruits, what is the food that gives energy and stay healthy all day?
<br>
<br>Besides rice and fruits, I also practice eating legumes such as chickpea, almonds and other legumes. This is because legumes are high source of protein for body. But make sure the legumes are not extreme because it contains high calories.
<br>
<br>The important thing is the key of healthy diet is calorie in and out when you eating and during daily activities, if over-calorie intake is supposed to be for the body, then the effect we will be on the risk of overweight and over time invites to more dangerous illness such as diabetic.

Some people say they skip the breakfast because the time constraints and there is no interest breakfast and they go to work with an empty stomach every morning. Individuals taking breakfast usually have healthy eating habits throughout the day and this has a positive effect on overall health, better weight management and disease prevention as they have the body's nutrients needed.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;To remain healthy and energetic, of course I should eat according to the food distribution that has been set in the nutrition table. And as a teacher I am convinced that at school's canteen provides clean food as the authorities will monitor it. But I am not sure of the food at the stall because of its cleanliness is less guaranteed quality. This can cause food poisoning from air pollution.
